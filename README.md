##Echonomics
Echonomics is a classroom alternative to traditional simulations of the stock market. Using a built in engine, *Echo* creates 
stocks, complete with factors such as volitility and trends, to create a lifelike stock market. Made for single-class use,
*Echo* compresses the update time of real-life markets so that players maintain a quick pace, competing agaisnt classmates
for the top spot on the leaderboard. A teacher, manning the server, can pause the server to point out ideas and concepts
that relate to Economics, overall creating an experience that is unbeat in terms of educational value in a Economics classroom!
